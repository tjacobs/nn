# Neural Network

This repo contains examples of Python code to build up a neural network from scratch.

We start with a very basic calculation of a three hidden node neural network.

Then we plot it, and generalize it.

Then we start measuring loss, and training it.

Run these with:

```
python3 main_01_basic.py
```
